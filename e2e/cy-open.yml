# Run web application and open Cypress Test Runner in a Docker container
# but send the X11 output to the server running on the host machine
# so you can see and interact with the tests. Most services are configured
# in the file docker-compose.yml, this file only overrides variables
# necessary for "cypress open" to work with X11.
# We need to use both file names to run:
#
#   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f cy-open.yml up --exit-code-from cypress
#
services:
    cypress:
        # Pass custom command to start Cypress otherwise it will use the entrypoint
        # specified in the Cypress Docker image.
        entrypoint: cypress open --project /e2e
        environment:
            - DISPLAY
        volumes:
            # For Cypress to communicate with the X11 server pass this socket file
            # in addition to any other mapped volumes.
            - /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix
